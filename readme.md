# Anonymous Credentials

This project will evaluate Threshold BBS+ and Threshold PS (Coconut) with respect to proof and verify times using shared components to fairly compare schemes.

I credit Lovesh Harchandani https://github.com/lovesh for his work on anonymous credentials as I've taken much inspiration from it
