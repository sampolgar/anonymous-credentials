# cryptography playground in rust

## ZKP path

1. code a simple proof in Rust (Alice knows x and wants to verify with Bob)
2. increase complexity (proof of 2 secrets, then 3 secrets)
3. change the computational problem. Schnorr & Pedersen use Discrete Log, I'll start there and see

## Merkle Tree

1. create tree
2. create proof of existence in tree

## Credentials

### single-use

1.

### multi-use
